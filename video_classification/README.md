# TensorFlow Lite Python video classification example with Raspberry Pi.

This example uses [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite) with Python
on a Raspberry Pi to perform real-time video classification using images
streamed from the camera.

## Set up your hardware

Before you begin, you need to [set up your Raspberry Pi](
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up) with
Raspberry Pi OS (preferably updated to Buster).

You also need to [connect and configure the Pi Camera](
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md) if you use the 
Pi Camera. This code also works with USB camera connect to the Raspberry Pi.

And to see the results from the camera, you need a monitor connected
to the Raspberry Pi. It's okay if you're using SSH to access the Pi shell
(you don't need to use a keyboard connected to the Pi)â€”you only need a monitor
attached to the Pi to see the camera stream.


## Install the TensorFlow Lite runtime

In this project, all you need from the TensorFlow Lite API is the `Interpreter`
class. So instead of installing the large `tensorflow` package, we're using the
much smaller `tflite_runtime` package.

To install this on your Raspberry Pi, follow the instructions in the
[Python quickstart](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python#install_tensorflow_lite_for_python).

You can install the TFLite runtime using this script.

```
sh setup.sh
```

## Download the example files

First, clone this Git repo onto your Raspberry Pi like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/khanhlvg/tflite_raspberry_pi --depth 1
```

Then use our script to install a couple Python packages:

```
cd video_classification

# The script install the required dependencies and download the TFLite models.
sh setup.sh
```

## Run the example

```
python3 classify.py
```
*   You can optionally specify the `model` parameter to set the TensorFlow Lite model to be used:
    * The default value is `movinet_a0_int8.tflite`
    * This sample currently uses MoviNet-A0, but it supports all TensorFlow Lite [MoviNet video classification](https://tfhub.dev/s?deployment-format=lite&q=movinet) 
    models that are available on TensorFlow Hub. You can use the larger variant of MoviNet if you need higher accuracy. 
*   You can optionally specify the `maxResults` parameter to limit the list of classification results:
    * Supported value: A positive integer.
    * Default value: `3`.
*   Example usage:
```
python3 classify.py \
  --model movinet_a0_int8.tflite \
  --maxResults 5
```
